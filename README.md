### What I learned

This one took me a while. First of all, I knew about the ```<details>``` and ```<summary>``` html tags, so I wanted to solve this without using JavaScript. 

I think there's a lot to improve here. I couldn't figure out how to move the box when hover one question, instead of this, I "solved" this moving the box when hover all the container. I know this isn't ideal and probably there's something I am missing from css selectors. If you have any suggestion about this I will be thankfull.
